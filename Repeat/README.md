1. 常见的研究方向：

* Fragile X Syndrome

* amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
    + 肌萎縮性脊髓側索硬化症

* Huntington's disease

2. 该分析目前只适用全基因组分析（PCR-free libraries文库，Repeats are only genotyped if the coverage at the locus is at least 10x）


3. 拓展重复数据分析区域的大小默认是1000bp **--repeat-genotype-region-extension-length=1000**

4. dragen在重复序列STR进行检测适用的 ExpansionHunter算法。

5. Short tandem repeats (STRs) (also known as microsatellite DNA) consist of 1–6 bp motifs, <br>
   and it has been estimated that there are over 1 million discrete STR loci in the human genome, constituting around 3% of genomic DNA6. <br>
   Thousands of these loci have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression7,8. Minisatellite DNA consists of longer (>6 bp) motifs in tandem repetition.
